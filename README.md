# Hunt Helper

Imagine you are trying to land that job. There are so many tasks you need complete to get the (job) hunt done right.

-   You need to work on your professional checklist.
-   You need to share your progress on Twitter or BlueSky.
-   You need to work on your rÃ©sumÃ©.
-   You need to find companies that are hiring.
-   You need to find people at those companies to network with.
-   All told, you will find around 60 companies and send 180 messages ðŸ˜µ

How are you going to work through something that is so emotionally challenging and physically taxing?

ðŸª„ Enter: **Hunt Helper**

Using the time-tested, research-backed techniques from Atomic Habits, Pomodoro, and spaced repetition, we present an Anki-style experience: you are invited to work on small Atomic prompts from the Hunt for only a few minutes at a time.

Can you dedicate two minutes to working on the emotionally challenging task you've been avoiding that will really move the needle on your job hunt?
